⭐ STAR Format Results
💡 Situation
Jamboree aims to improve the chances of its students getting admitted into Ivy League colleges by leveraging machine learning to predict admission probabilities for Indian applicants.

💡 Task
The goal is to perform a detailed regression analysis to identify key predictors that influence admission probabilities and provide actionable insights to optimize the admissions process.

💡 Actions Taken
Conducted data preprocessing, including handling missing values, detecting and treating duplicates, and addressing outliers.
Performed univariate and bivariate analyses using statistical and graphical techniques to understand the relationships between variables like GRE scores, TOEFL scores, and CGPA.
Developed and evaluated various models: Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and ElasticNet to predict admission probabilities.
Evaluated model performance using key metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.
Checked for multicollinearity using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) scores and analyzed residuals for normality and heteroscedasticity.
💡 Results
Key Predictors: CGPA, GRE score, and TOEFL score emerged as the most significant factors influencing admission chances.
Model Performance: The models explained up to 82% of the variance in admission probabilities, with some residual normality issues that were addressed through model refinement.
Recommendations: Jamboree should focus on enhancing key academic predictors (e.g., CGPA, GRE, TOEFL) while also exploring ways to diversify applicant profiles by considering non-academic factors like research experience and strong personal statements.
📈 Visual Analysis
The following visual tools were employed to interpret and present the results:

Box Plots & Violin Plots: To explore the distribution of key features like GRE scores and TOEFL scores.
Regression Plots: To visualize the relationships between features and the target variable (Chance of Admit).
Residual Plots: To check model fit and diagnose any potential issues.
📊 Conclusion
This case study provides valuable insights into the admissions process and highlights the importance of academic performance, particularly GRE, TOEFL, and CGPA. By refining its predictive models, Jamboree can further support students in achieving their Ivy League aspirations.

Through the application of machine learning and statistical analysis, this study offers practical experience in building models, making data-driven decisions, and optimizing predictive accuracy.
